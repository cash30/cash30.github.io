    <p> <strong>Computer security</strong>, cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems
        and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data,
        as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>

    <p>The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and
        Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT)</p>

    <p> Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies 
        they support. Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as power
        distribution, elections, and finance</p>
    
    
        
        
        <h3 id="phishing-attacks">Phishing attacs</h3>
    <p> Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the
        users. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose 
        look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often asks for personal information, such as login details and passwords.
        This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be 
        classified as a form of social engineering. Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts. A common scam is for attackers to send 
        fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music, apps, or others, and instructing them to click on a link if the
        purchases were not authorized. A more strategic type of phishing is spear-phishing which leverages personal or organization-specific details to make 
        the attacker appear like a trusted source. Spear-phishing attacks target specific individuals, rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts.</p>

        
        
        
    <h3 id="malware">malware</h3>
    <p>Malicious software (malware) installed on a computer can leak any information, such as personal information, business information and passwords, can give
        control of the system to the attacker, and can corrupt or delete data permanently</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>backdoor</h3>
        <p>A backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist
            for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access,
            or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability. Backdoors can be very hard 
            to detect, and backdoors are usually discovered by someone who has access to application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system 
            of the computer.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Denial-of-service attack</h3>
        <p>Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to
            individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they
            may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked 
            by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number
            of points â€“ and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible
            techniques, including reflection and amplification attacks, where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

        <h3>Side-channel attack</h3>
        <p>Any computational system affects its environment in some form. This effect it has on its environment, includes a wide range of criteria, which can 
            range from electromagnetic radiation, to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequent make a Cold boot attack possible, to hardware
            implementation faults that allow for access and or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible. In Side-channel attack scenarios, 
            the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is 
            assumed by the victim to be secure.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Privilege escalation</h3>
        <p>Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their 
            privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted
            data; or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Reverse engineering</h3>
        <p>Reverse engineering is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, code, and architecture, or to extract knowledge
            from the object; similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon.</p>
